# Arcade Snake Game

A short game made with Python3 Turtle library to simulate the classic arcade game Snake.

A player controls a small snake with the "up", "down", "left", and "right" arrow keys in order to eat berries. With each berry eaten, the snake will increase in one unit length and the score will increase accordingly.

The player can loose in two cases:

- When the snake touches the outer walls.
- When the snake touches itself.

In which case, the game will be lost and the highest score noted and kept for next use.
